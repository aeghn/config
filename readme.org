#+TITLE: My System Spec

* Apps
  There are some apps in my work and daily life.
** Launcher And Status Bar
   **On GNU/Linux**, I wrote my own launcher and status bar based on Rust + GTK3/4.

   - RGLauncher: A launcher, to launch app, to switch windows, to query some words and to do some calculates, etc.
   - RGBar: A status bar, with graph support.

    **On Windows**, I use =Win+s= to start app and taskbar(with [[https://github.com/zhongyang219/TrafficMonitor][Traffic Monitor]]) as the status bar.
** Terminal
   **On GNU/Linux**, I use foot as my main terminal emulator, because it is fast, lightweight and _without_ GPU acceleration.
