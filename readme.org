#+TITLE: My System Spec

* Apps
  There are some apps in my work and daily life.

** System
   *On GNU/Linux*, I choose to use ArchLinux, very stable and never outdated.

   I compiled the kernel for my laptop [[https://github.com/aeghn/arch-pkgs][linux-15iah7]].

   *On Windows*, I choose to use Windows 10, have no plan to go to Windows 11.

** Launcher And Status Bar
   *On GNU/Linux*, I wrote my own launcher and status bar based on Rust + GTK3/4.

   _link_: [[https://github.com/aeghn/rglauncher][RGLauncher]] [[https://github.com/aeghn/rgbar][RGBar]]

   - RGLauncher: A launcher, to launch app, to switch windows, to query some words and to do some calculates, etc.
   - RGBar: A status bar, with graph support.

     *On Windows*, I use =Win+s= to start app and taskbar(with [[https://github.com/zhongyang219/TrafficMonitor][Traffic Monitor]]) as the status bar.

** Terminal
   *On GNU/Linux*, I use foot as my main terminal emulator, because it is fast, lightweight and /without/ GPU acceleration.

   *On Windows*, I prefer to use WezTerm with Msys2 + UCRT.

   I use zsh daily, I have used my own zsh prompt for years, which support async git status.
   Great Terminal Tools:
   - =ripgrep=, fast text greper.
   - =fd=, fast find alternative.
   - =gdu=, disk analyzer.
   - =htop=, process monitor.
   - =bandwidth=, network monitor.
   - =fzf=, fast and fuzzy filter.
   - =git-filter-repo=, git repo reshape tool.
   - =dufs=, simple file server.

   And I have wrote some bash scripts to make life easy, e.g, my dotfiles is orginized by =dfs=, =dfm=.

** Browser
   [[file:_data/preview/browser.png]]

   I'd like to use firefox with some modification.

   Great Firefox Plugins:
   - *Sidebery*: Tree tab manager, which I think is better than tree-style-tab.
   - *Imagus*: Enlarge thumbnails, and show images/videos from links with a mouse hover.
   - *PopUp*: Create a popup of pages, with minimal browser UI
   - *SingleFile*: SingleFile helps you to save a complete page (with CSS, images, etc.) into a single HTML file.
   - *block-images*: Blocks all images on webpage.

** Emacs
   [[file:_data/preview/emacs.png]]
